# Jumbotron
A lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site.

The jumbotron is a div with rounded corners and it uses utility classes for typography and spacing to space content out within the larger container.

The jumbotron will take up 100% of its containing element. Thus put into a .container class to have max-width and centering. 

Or make it 100% of the VIEWPORT with .jumbotron-fluid and use a .container inside for the elements.
