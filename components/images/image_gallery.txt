FIGURE BACKGROUND

Set a BACKGROUND-COLOR at the <figure> and play with the OPACITY of the <img> element to let the background-color shine through. On :hover you change it to BLACK so that the overlapping text has good contrast for readability.

IMG WIDTH 

By default set it to 100%, if you want to animate effects you can start at width: calc(100% + 50px); for example.

OVERLAPPPING CONTENT TEXT/BUTTONS

Create a markup such that the <figcaption> has two parts: a title or text that is visibile by default and a <div> with additional content that becomes only visible on :hover. 

You can scale that content up first with opacity: 0; and scale(1.3); On :hover you create zoom out effect to scale(1) and opacity:1.

CUT OFF CORNER

Use a pseude element on the <figure> element with z-index:2; rotate it on an angle position it out of sight by default. On :hover you move it into place. Use a circle or rotated square to ge the shape you want.
