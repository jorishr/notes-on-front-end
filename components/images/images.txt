I.	ABOUT
###########

Image content is defined outside of the web page that renders it. 

We can refer to these external resources from within an HTML document by using the absolute, relative, and root-relative URLs.

<img> tag has SOURCE attribute, which points to the image file you want to display. 
	
	<img src="" alt=""> is an empty element like <hr> en <br>.

NOTE: by default images are in-line elements and get assigned a little white space underneath. To correct this: use css display: block;

With future ANIMATIONS or ADVANCED POSITIONING in mind it may be best to put the <img> element inside a container <div>.

Since HTML5 it is also best to put the entire thing inside a <figure> element.

######################
II.	IMAGE DIMENSIONS
######################

By default, the <img> ELEMENT uses the INHERITED dimensions of the image file itself. 

Setting both width="" or height="" will cause the image to stretch. If you only one property, the image will scale proportionately.

Dimension values are specified in pixels, and you should NEVER include a unit in HTML. Thus width="75".

III.	IMAGE ATTRIBUTES
######################

Adding the alternative text ALT attribute is good pratice. It helps search enigines and screen readers. Screen readers will communicate this ALT="VALUE" to visually impaired people.

The TITLE attribute will be visible when a user hovers over an image.
 
    <img    src="/images/red_flower.png" 
            title="A red flower" 
            alt="An image of a red flower">

IV.	IMAGE QUALITY
###################             

Statistically speaking you can get away with 85% before the user notices a difference. 

Quality reduction can be done automatically or manually;

LINUX:      GIMP, PNGQUANT --strip or IMAGEOPTIM
WINDOWS:    FileOptimizer application

Taskrunners/build tool plugins: imagemin and svgo packages

##################
V.	IMAGE FORMAT
##################

1.  PIXEL-based formats: jpg, png, gif 

For photos: use jpg, can handle large color pallets without increasing too much in size.

Simple animations: gifs 
NOTE: problematic for transparency against background

PNG: allround for icons, diagrams, logos,...

IMPORTANT: pixel-based imgs need to be twice the size you want them to appear on RETINA displays. Thus you may need two or four versions:

    350x250 for standard mobile
    700x500 for retina mobile

    600x400 for standard screens
    1200x800 for retina screens

2.  VECTOR-based graphics

Scale up and down without quality loss, great for responsive design and mobile. Problematic when text is present inside the image.
