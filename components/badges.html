    BADGES

    Badges can be added to titles, links and buttons. You can create them with
    PSEUDO ELEMENTS ::before and ::after in CSS or rely on a <span> element.
    BOOTSTRAP also offers a BADGE CLASS to be used inside a <span>.
    
    1.  PSEUDO ELEMENTS

    Add pseudo element to the CSS of a title, link or button with the CONTENT
    property set to '' or for example 'NEW' as a BADGE.

    You can adjust background, height and width and position with 
    position:absolute and position relative on the containing element. You can
    use JS to toggle this class based on certain conditions.

    .title::after {
        content: 'NEW'
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        border-radius: 50%;
    }

    2. BOOTSTRAP BADGES 

    Bootstrap badges scale automatically with the heading it belongs to.

    Colors can follow the standard bootstrap color scheme: danger, warning, 
    success, etc. .badge .badge-warning
-->
    <h1>Example heading <span class="badge badge-secondary">New</span></h1>
