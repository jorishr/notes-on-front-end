MODAL
#####

MARKUP
The markup is straigthforward: a div with content.

CSS
By default this is container is set to display: none; and or opacity: 0;

When the modal is open: z-index: 10;

BLUR BACKGROUND

To make the background elements blurred out you can use a box-shadow. The box-shadow does not affect other elements and does not cause scrolling. You simple use a SPREAD of 100vw.

	.modal { box-shadow: 0 0 0 100vw rgba(0, 0, 0, .35) }
