TOOLTIPS/POP-UPS/SNACKBAR
#########################

############
I.	MARKUP
############

The principle for tooltips and pop-ups is similar: hidden by default, animated-in. 

The CALL OUT is the other way around: visibile and fixed by default, for the user to click away with X (display: none) or follow link to cta. 

Tooltips are added as HTML div with a span text that has css visibility:hidden / display: none / opacity: 0. The opacity is added because you can transition the style.

On hover or click the visbility is set to visible.

	div.tooltip
		span.text

	.text {visibility:hidden}
	.tooltip:hover .text{visibility: visible}

If you want the tooltip inside a text then add the dots under the hoverable text set
	
 	.tooltip {border-bottom: 1px dotted black}

#################
II.	POSITIONING
#################

Set the container to position:relative and the text can be set with position:absolute;

  position: absolute;
  left: 105%; (on the right)| right:105% (on the left)

To position on top or bottom you can use bottom/top:100% 

To arrows and shapes see seperate doc or W3C site.
