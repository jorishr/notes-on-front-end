PAGE SECTIONS
#############

Usually a webpage will have:

A HEADER SECTION which includes advertising and a navbar, the HERO SECTION which is the eyecatcher with a call to action or main stories, and various other sections untill you get to the FOOTER SECTION.

These sections may have common css features that can be re-used from a MODULE _page-section.scss

Thus make sure that those section are wrapped into a container div in with shared class in your html markup.

In css you define the base-styles for each section with for 
example, padding.

Modifiers classes can be added to make changes in media-queries or adding alternating background colors.

NOTE

For seperating page section it's often enough just work with padding on every other section. But that will depend on the design.

EXAMPLE: ALTERNATING BACKGROUND COLOR FOR EVEN/ODD SECTIONS

Exclude the first section which may be a hero with specific styles. 

Select the even and odd section with the pseudo class 
	
	:nth-child()

 	section:not(section1):nth-child(even){background-color: red}

 	section:not(section1):nth-child(uneven){background: blue}

THUS: ---- section1 excluded
      ---- section2 1 uneven: blue
      ---- section3 2 even: red
      ---- section4 3 uneven: blue
      ---- section5 4 even: red
