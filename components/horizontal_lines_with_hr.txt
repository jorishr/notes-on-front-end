HORIZONTAL LINES WITH THE HORIZONTAL RULE ELEMENT

The <hr> is a block level element. 

If you want to use it as part of your page style you should set the width,
height and color.

To avoid default browser styles set the border to 0.

hr {
    width: 250px;
    height: 3px;
    color: blue;
    border: 0;
}
