Thing to take into account:
- color and contrast
- size (visual hierarchy)
- the ad copy (right text content)
- relevance


Use the css class .cta

It usually consists of a div box with:
- title
- text
- btn

The button can take up the entire width of the screen or the container. To do so use CALC:

    width: calc(100% - 1em);
