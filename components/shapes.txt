############
I.	ARROWS
############

You can use pseudo elements ::before or ::after to add an empty element with a border to create an arrow shape to add to a tooltip. Position absolute to get it into place and position relative to the parent.

ARROW are created with square boxes that have no width or height, only a border-width. On all side the color is set to transparent, except for the arrow side.

  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: black transparent transparent transparent;

The order: top, right, bottom, left;

II.	SQUARES
#############

HEIGHT/WIDTH OF SQUARES

Using padding-bottom: 30%; in the CSS will set the height for the squares. When you specify the height or width as a percentage, that's a percentage with respect to the element's parent.

###############################
III. SKEWED SECTION BACKGROUNDS
###############################

You create .bg-container that you can SKEW with transform: skewY(-2deg). 

Note that you need the skew the CONTENT back into the opposite direction.

Important is that the skew happens on both top and bottom. If you want the section the end with a straight edge you need another container that is bigger and has the same bg-color.

For example, the footer needs to be larger (height) than the container that generate the skew effect (.footer-bg-container) to compensate for skew and still keep a straight edge at the bottom.

ALTERNATIVE: use a clippath. This is easier, as you don't have to correct the content.

###############################################
IV.	UPWARDS/DOWNWARDS ROUNDED SECTION CORNERS
###############################################

Pseudo elements can be used to create two overlapping shapes: a square and circle that create the illusion of upwards rounded corner. The circle has to be double the size of the square and white.

The downwards rounded corner edge is a simple border-radius equal to the size of the square.

######################
V.	CLIP PATH SHAPES
######################

Use an empty div element.

Set the widht and height to 100% and position absolute as the clip path is drawn all over the screen, even though the actual shape only takes up part of it.

Give it a background-color.

The clip-path property can be generated with an online tool CLIPPY.

You can use multiple element and z-index to overlap and complement more then one shape.
