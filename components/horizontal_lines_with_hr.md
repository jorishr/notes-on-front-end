# Horizontal lines 
The horizontal rule element hr is a block level element. 

If you want to use it as part of your page style you should set the width,
height and color. To avoid default browser styles set the border to 0.
```CSS
hr {
    width: 250px;
    height: 3px;
    color: blue;
    border: 0;
}
