The example below is taken from  the 'Travel Site' project. It features a div .site-header__logo with inside two child elements:
an <svg> element that scale easily, and a __logo__seoText div with text that could a title and a paragraph.

The containing div .site-header__logo is set to position: absolute, top: 0 to make it stick to the top. And pulled into position with left: 50% and transform: translate -50%

Note that the <svg> requires the <use href=""></use> element inside. And the color in CSS is set through the fill: <color>; property.

When using simple text as brand name best use UPPERCASE, either in HTML or through CSS.

SEO CONTENT

Create a <div> that contains SEO text (title/description) and use the CSS text-ident property or font-size: 0; to make it invisible.

	__logo__seotext {
		text-indent: -9999px; 
		font-size: 0;
	}
	 
The SVG image should be set to a max-width and max-height to avoid scaling too far beyond the .site-header.

CENTERING DIV WITH POSITION ABSOLUTE: 

	left/right:50% + transform:translateX(-50%)


SCALE LOGO DIV FOR MOBILE

The .site-header__logo <div> is scalled back on mobile to 80%. The transform origin 50-50 starts from the exact center point of the <div> which we don't want. To have it stick to the top the scaling down is only done on the X-axis.

transform: scale(.8) 
transform-origin: 50% 0% (50-50 is default). This way the logo will continue to stick to the top.

2.	BOOTSTRAP

The .navbar-brand class can be added to all elements but recommended is the <a> tag.

 	<nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-light">
  		<a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
	</nav>

Adding images is going to require custom css anyway, whereby the <img> is wrapped into the <a> tag.
Note the .d-inline-block class for the image, as it is inline by default.

 
 	<nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-light">
  		<a class="navbar-brand" href="#">
    		<img src="" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="">
   		Bootstrap
  		</a>	
	</nav>
