ARIA

Accessible Rich Internet Applications are usually html attributes that make webpages more accessible for visually impaired users through screenreaders.

ChromeVox is an example of a screenreader plugin.

Example:

nav
	ul	
		li

Will be read as navigation out loud, list, link.
Thus rely on the html5 elements first.


Google the components you want to make aria accessible.
