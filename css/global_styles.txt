PROJECT GLOBAL CSS STYLES
#########################

What you include in the _global.scss file can differ from project to project but these are some recommendations.

BORDER, MARGIN AND PADDING

Margins will be 0 by default for all elements when you use a reset style sheet but not padding and border.

Box-sizing is advisable as it simplifies things but take into account that you may have to change that to accomodate certain features.

* { 
    	padding: 0; 
    	border: 0; 
	box-sizing: border-box;
}

IMAGES

Images may force you to scroll horizontally when they are very large. Avoid this by setting a max-width and auto height.

img {
    max-width: 100%;    // this avoids horizontal scrolling
    height: auto;  
}

ANCHOR TAGS

Set a default color for all link tags.

a {color:;}		

FONT

Apply a font-family and font color to the body. This will streamline things from the beginning. 

Also provide similar back-up fonts. For example, 
	
	"Lucida Grande", "Lucida Sans", Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; 

body {
    	font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    	color: #333;
	background-color: ;
} 

Also think about a background-color. This can be a slightly lesser white or lesser black that is the fall-back for when your site has loading issues.

HEADINGS

Some common features may be defined in the global styles or in seperate partial file.
