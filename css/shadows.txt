I.	TEXT SHADOW
#################

A.	TEXT SHADOW

Use the css text-shadow property. 

There are various components to text shadows: the color, the blur and the off-set (x/y axis).

 	text-shadow: <offset x> <offset y> <blur> <color>

OFFSET

The offset is usually very subtil with only a couple of pixels to the right and down. 

Without an offset and only blur you can create a GLOW effect.
	
	h1 {
		text-shadow: 0px 0px 5px red; 
	}

BLUR

Can lengthen and fade out the shadow. If you leave it at 0 the shadow will be solid.


EXAMPLES

	WHITE TEXT BLACK SHADOW
	
Dark shadow offset, no blur. The rgba makes it subtle by setting opacity to just 10%.

		text-shadow: 2px 2px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, .1); 
	
	WHITE BACKGROUND AND COLORED SHADOW 

Slight offset to the right, larger offset down, blur and green.	
		
 	text-shadow: 2px 5px 4px green; 
      
	COMBINE VARIOUS SHADOWS

Combine two types of shadows with different color.

 	text-shadow: 0px 0px 5px red, -5px -5px 3px yellow;


################
II.	BOX SHADOW
################

A.	ABOUT

Adding a box-shadow to cards or other block elements gives depth to your page.

It is best used with an OFFSET on the RIGHTt and BOTTOM. A subtle offset on the bottom makes it less pronounced at the top and darker at the bottom.

COLORS: The default value is the color property of the element. Recommended is the use of a subtle grey or a color that is close the color of the element you create a shadow for.

The threshold is at about 30 or 35% of OPACITY for the same color. Above it, the contrast stands out too much. About 25% is good for solid black.

For colored dropshadows, stick to the main color and go to a lighter HUE, again at about 30 or 35% of the original.


B.	SYNTAX
 
box-shadow: 
	<h-offset> <v-offset> <blur> <spread> <color>;

NOTE: The BLUR is the blur-radius, thus 20px means it takes 20px to go from color solid to faded-out completely.

The SPREAD is the value from WHERE the blur STARTS. Thus instead of immediately it only starts at 20px, for example. Now, if you don't add a blur value, you have a solid shadow form 0 to 20px and then nothing. 

If you make the spread a NEGATIVE value you can create very subtle shadows as they start 'inside' the element, thereby hiding the starting point of the blur.


C.	LIFTING ELEMENTS HIGHER

To lift an element UP you can increase the BLUR effect to 60px for example. If you also take down the opacity the effect is amplified even more.

When animating elements that SCALE UP or DOWN you can also add a bigger/smaller box-shadow to create the effect of the element coming towards the user. The BLUR should TRIPLE in size.

When working OVERLAPPING elements, differentiate the BLUR to make sure the layers are clearly visible.


D.	INSET/PUSHING ELEMENTS DOWN INTO THE BACKGROUND

To create a shadow inside the element you add the keyword INSET (and use negative offset values).

Here too: the stronger the blur, the more pronounced the effect.


E.	FAKE BORDER

You can create a solid border through the box-shadow property by using: 

	box-shadow: 0 0 0 <spread> color;
	box-shadow: 0 0 0 10px red;

EXAMPLES

A negative value for the spread reduce the length of the shadow. A good rule of thumb is to use half of the offset.

 	box-shadow: 0 -20px 15px -10px rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3) inset;
	box-shadow: 5px 5px 25px 0 rgba(0,0,0, .25);


###########################
III.	FAKE/MULTIPLY BORDERS
###########################

See CODEPEN examples.

Basically have multiple shadows that partially overlap.

Note: use box-sizing: border-box; or INSET to avoid the element size expansion.


Another options is to use the OUTLINE property. Especially with wide OUTLINES in black but transparent can generate a nice effect.

IV. FILTER: DROP-SHADOW
#######################
On for example an svg the box-shadow will apply to the 'box' of the image,not necesarily the element inside the svg, even though the svg may have a transparent background.

Filter can overcome this issue:

.filter-shadow {
	filter: drop-shadow(.75em .75em .5em)
}
