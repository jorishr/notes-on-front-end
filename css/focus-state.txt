FOCUS
#####

The default :focus state differs by browsers and is usually not very pretty.

Outlines don't affect the document flow, just as box-shadows you can make them as large as you want without an effect on surrounding elements.

Focus state is important to account for people that use keyboard navigation.

You can create a box around it in a custom color. This works well for TEXT-LINKS.

a:focus {
	outline: 3px red;
	outline-offset: 2px;
}

For rounded buttons you can use TWO BOXSHADOWS to create a nice circle around the button.

a:focus {
	box-shadow:
		0 0 0 5px <bg/white>;
		0 0 0 10px <color>;
}
