FOCUS
#####

The default :focus state differs by browsers and is usually not very pretty.

Outlines don't affect the document flow, just as box-shadows you can make them as large as you want without an effect on surrounding elements.

Focus state is important to account for people that use keyboard navigation.

You can create a box around it in a custom color. This works well for TEXT-LINKS.

a:focus {
	outline: 3px red;
	outline-offset: 2px;
}

For rounded buttons you can use TWO BOXSHADOWS to create a nice circle around the button.

a:focus {
	box-shadow:
		0 0 0 5px <bg/white>;
		0 0 0 10px <color>;
}


KEYBOARD NAVIGATION

Some users prefer to navigate a site through keyboard only, using tab, arrows and enter. 

CSS FOCUS STATE
When you set outline: none to avoid the default browser frame you will have to specify other :focus styles so that users can see which btn or item is selected. 
The easy way out it make it the same as the :hover styles.
