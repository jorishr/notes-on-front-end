I.	BACKGROUND BLEND MODE
###########################

Use a color as background with and IMAGE on top of it and play around with the property:

	background-blend-mode: <value>;
	
	multiply/darken: emphasis on the darkest colors in the image	with the background color blended in
	
	screen/lighten: opposite of multiply, more emphasis on the	 	lightest colors	

	luminosity: blends in the background color into image
	
	overlay: light layer on top of image

The results vary depending on the type of color you use in the background. Combining it with a gradient can get good results as well.

Instead of a bg color you can blend two images into each other as well but this a lot of try and error.

The mix-blend-mode property works the same as background-blend-mode with the same values.

The difference is you apply it to stacked elements that you want to be partially see-through.
