JSX
###

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and allows to write HTML inside JS. Very little difference with HTML, but self-closing elements like <img> need to be written like: <img/>

To return html over multiple lines use:

function App(){
	 return (
		<div>
			<h1>title</h1>
			<h3>subtitle</h3>
		</div>
	)
}

Note that to have mulitple HTML elements inside the same return statement you need to have in a WRAPPER DIV as above OR use the JSX syntax without the need for extra elements:

function App(){
	 return (
		<>
			<h1>title</h1>
			<h3>subtitle</h3>
		</>
	)
}
If you put multiple elements without a wrapper or <> you get a fragments error.

ATTRIBUTES

The 'class' is a reserved keyword in JS and cannot be used. Therefore, use the attribute className=""

Same thing for the 'for' in the <label>, use <label htmlFor="">
