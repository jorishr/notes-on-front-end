# ARIA
Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) are usually build with html attributes that make webpages more accessible for visually impaired users through screenreaders.

ChromeVox is an example of a screenreader plugin that will read navigation, llst, link out loud to the user. In the first place it will rely upon the HTML5 semantic elements.

Other examples are the Bootstrap aria-... classes.

Example:
```
nav
	ul	
		li
```
