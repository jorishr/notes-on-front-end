DEBUG ERROR REPORTING FOR DOM MANIPULATION CODE
###############################################

At the BOTTOM of the JS file you can add custom error reporting to generate custom errors if something is missing.

This may seem redundant but makes debugging at a later stage much more efficient.

EXAMPLE
if(!ul) throw new Error('Could not find <CSS selector>')
if(!btn) throw new Error('Could not find <CSS selector>')
if(!form) throw new Error('Could not find <CSS selector>')

This code must be at the bottom of the js file as the error generation may interfere with other code that does run correctly.
