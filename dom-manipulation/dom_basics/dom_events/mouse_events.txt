MOUSE EVENTS
############

click and dblclick are complex events that consist of a sequence of mousedown/mouseup events that are already preconfigured.

Click-related events always have the WHICH property, which allows to get the exact mouse button.

event.which = 1;		//-> left button
event.which = 2;		//-> middle button
event.which = 3;		//-> right button

MODIFIERS
Be careful with modifiers if your code is going to run on a pc/mac or mobile devices without keyboards.

button.onclick = function(event) {
    if (event.altKey && event.shiftKey) {
      alert('Hooray!');
    }
}

COORDINATES
All mouse events have coordinates in two flavours:

Window-relative: clientX and clientY.
Document-relative: pageX and pageY.

PREVENT COPYING TEXT
<div oncopy="alert('Copying forbidden!');return false">
  Dear user,
  The copying is forbidden for you.
  If you know JS or HTML, then you can get everything from the page source though.
</div>
