JS ORGANIZATION

MAIN.JS CODE RUN ONLY ON SPECIFIC PAGES

The have this script run only the pages that have the share icons you have various options: include a seperate script on each page. Or, better, make it part of the main.js file and wrap the code in a function that has an a conditional statement in it. This is escpecially useful when you want to have modular code.

The challenge is to identify the pages that have or don't have social icons. The best way is to add a class to the body tag of that page. 

When working with template engines however, this is more complicated as the body tag is part of the header template. 
The workaround is to add a small script tag at the bottom of the page to add a class to the document.body.classList.add('<class>').
