GOOD CODING PRACTICES

HTML TAGS

Closing the EMPTY html elements with "/>" is not required but makes it is better readable for XML readers. 

LINES

Avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

FILENAMES

Always use lower case file-names.

QUOTATIONS

Always use CURLY quotation marks double or single:
Double:     &ldquo;(open) and &rdquo; (close)
Single:     &lsquo; and &rsquo;

STYLE GUIDLINES FOR SMALLER SCREENS

- reduce padding and margins (30%-50%)
- reduce font-size (20%)
- reduce button size (10%)
- start applying the desktop layout CSS from atMedium onwards.

TROUBLESHOOTING CSS SCROLL BARS

If you have a horizontal scroll bar you can use the border property but that affects the markup of the document. Use outline property instead.

* { border: 1px solid red; }
* { outline: 2px solid red; }
