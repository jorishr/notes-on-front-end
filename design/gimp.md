# Gimp Image Editing
## Files format
The .xcf format stores all the layers and changes you made to the original. Save it for later reference. Use the export function to create the file format you want to use in your projects. To import files, just drag it into the canvas.

## Drop shadow for text and titles
Select all characters. Right click on the layer and select ALPHA SELECTION and go to FILTERS.

## Create boxes with text
Add a new layer behind the text. Edit and fill with color.

## Scale up and down with layers
Select the layer and rotate or scale.

## Remove a background
Add alpha channel to the layer. Duplicate the layer. Desaturate. Colors: invert.

Colors: levels and make the background as dark as needed, the logic is that what is white we will keep.

Paint the entire part of the image you want to keep white.
