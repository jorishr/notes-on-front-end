One or two page document that outlines the work to be done with a cost estimation and timeline:

- project description

- target audience

- competitors/examples for inspiration

- feature list (excluding basic functionality such as footers, headers and contact page)

- additional features that are not included but come up 
afterwards are billed extra

- deliverables:
What are you going to show to the client: low fidelity wireframe, high fidelity wireframe, user testing report, UI report and assets for the developers (icons, fonts,xd prototype)

- cost:
About 100 EUR/hour, thus 800 EUR/day
Additional work billed at 90 EUR/day
Estimate on the basis of how many days you think it takes to complete the job + a margin of (half) a day for unforseen issues.
50% advance payment

- exact timeline of deliverables

TEMPLATE SETUP (DESKTOP)

Set the screen width. Use a 1920x1080 template but adjust the layout column to 1366 or that what is most commonly expected to be the screen of your users based on analytics.

How-to: 
- set to one column, set the width, revert back to 12 column grid.
- set the window height (under vertical) to 768 to get the dotted blue on the template to indicate edge of the page, everything below that line needs to be scrolled to to be visible

Name the homepage: Homepage - 1366w

Also UNGROUP to adjust individual elements.

ALIGN AND SPACE EVENLY
Select multiple elements and space evenly: see sidebar on top

SYMBOLS/COMPONENTS
Changes made in one place will be pushed automatically to all other copies on the different art boards. One exceptions: text changes. These have to pushed using 'push override'.
