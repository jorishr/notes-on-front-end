## Project brief
The project brief is a one or two page document that outlines the work to be done with a cost estimation and timeline:
- project description
- target audience
- competitors/examples for inspiration
- feature list (excluding basic functionality such as footers, headers and contact page)
- additional features that are not included but come up afterwards are billed extra
- deliverables: What are you going to show to the client: low fidelity wireframe, high fidelity wireframe, user testing report, UI report and assets for the developers (icons, fonts, xd prototype)
- cost: estimate about 100 EUR/hour, thus 800 EUR/day. Additional work billed at 90 EUR/hour. Estimate on the basis of how many days you think it takes to complete the job + a margin of (half) a day for unforseen issues. 50% advance payment
- exact timeline of deliverables
