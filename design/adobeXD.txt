II.	ANIMATIONS AND NAVIGATING BETWEEN TABLES
##############################################

In the prototype tab you can set animations on each element, with triggers that can be time, tap, etc. 

Remember that you always have an INITIAL STATE table and one or more INTERMEDIATE OR END STATES that are represented by work tables themselves.

The navigation also requires a trigger. To go back and forth it may be necessary to duplicate a table an make slight changes. Put them below the original.
