## About frameworks and libraries
Both are libraries with pre-written code that can be leveraged into your projects. 

The KEY DIFFERENCE is that of CONTROL: from a library you pick and choose what you need for whatever you want to build. When using a framework you are restricted in what you can do. You have to follow rules and methodology to perform a chain of tasks that is necessary for your app to work. 

For a server-side framework lot's of server settings come pre-configured and that gives you less control but more time to focus on the application, rather than basic server setup.

EXPRESS is a light-weight framwework that still leaves relatively lots of blanks to fill in. As opposed to Ruby-On-Rails, for example, which is much more restricted and requires less code to write yourself.

## UI/CSS libraries
Examples: Bootstrap and Semantic UI

PROS
- faster dev because you can re-use existing prototypes instead of writing fully custom css for every single 	feature. 
- responsive or mobile first by default
- browser support and fully tested
- easy to work with in a team: predicitable code + good docs.

CON

All sites look similar, less customization.

## Front-end JS Frameworks
Example: React, Vue, Angular. The new Wordpress 5.0 is built using REACT and NodeJS.

PROS
- faster and well structured approach for big projects
- organized components with good state and data management
- fast performance (virtual DOM)

CONS 
- unnecessary complex for small projects
- framework updates can cause issues

## Backend Frameworks
Examples: Express (NodeJs), Laraval (PHP), Django (Python)

PROS
- built-in security saves you a lot time.
- built-in routing
- MVC: predictable code organization in model-view-control

CONS: none.
